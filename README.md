# Web 1: SASS - Lab Day

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Carefully review the `result.mp4` file. This is the expected output for your exercise. It is a video file so feel free to pause or replay the video as many times as you need to (watch what happens to the headings when scrolling!).
3. Only work with your `.scss` files. Create partials (_) to separate and organize your code. **Do not modify the HTML.**
4. To compile your SCSS files to CSS, you can run the SASS compiler in watch mode to compile every time you save your changes:

    ```bash
    sass -w ./scss/style.scss:./css/style.css
    ```

5. For mobile responsiveness, just make the website look neat like making the grid into one column or whatever you think looks best on a smaller screen.
6. Commit and push your changes once you are done.

Good luck!
